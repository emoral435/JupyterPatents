The stretch release adhesive can be used for extracting an electrical component from an interior surface of a housing of a mobile computing device. The stretch release adhesive can have a double-sided adhesive body configured to adhere the component to the interior surface of the housing. A portion of the double-sided adhesive body is configured to extend out from between the electrical component and the interior surface of the housing to provide a graspable portion. When the stretch release adhesive is adhered between the electrical component and the internal surface of the housing, the stretch release adhesive can receive a pulling force at the graspable portion. If pulled with enough force, the stretch release adhesive will extend outwardly from between the electrical component and the internal surface of the mobile computing device, then completely release the electrical component from the mobile computing device.  \n",
       "17                              An installation assembly and an associated method for forming a bonded join are provided to permit the adhesive attachment of a first workpiece, such as a patch, to a portion of a second workpiece. The installation assembly and the associated method provide for at least partial debulking of the adhesive prior to curing of the adhesive such that the resulting bondline may have improved mechanical properties as a result of having fewer voids and/or porosity. The installation assembly may include an installation stand and a carrier plate supported by the installation stand and including an attachment surface configured to carry the first workpiece. The installation stand also includes an adjustment mechanism for positioning a carrier plate to a first predefined position to define a gap between the first and second workpieces and also to a second predefined position such that a predetermined bondline thickness is defined between the first and second workpieces.  \n",

The printer includes a member, a printhead, and an applicator. A controller operates the printhead to eject a first material having a first coefficient of friction toward the member and operates the applicator to eject a second material having a second coefficient of friction toward the member. The second material has a higher melting temperature and a lower coefficient of friction than the first material. The printer further includes a curing device. The controller operates the curing device to direct radiation toward the member to cure the first material. The second material is cured into the first material.  \n",

The method of the present invention comprises the repeated steps of: (i) forming a solidified layer by irradiating a predetermined portion of a powder layer with a light beam, thereby allowing a sintering of the powder in the predetermined portion or a melting and subsequent solidification thereof; and (ii) forming another solidified layer by newly forming a powder layer on the resulting solidified layer, followed by the irradiation of a predetermined portion of the powder layer with the light beam; wherein only the surface portion of the solidified layer, to which a force is applied when the three-dimensional shaped object is used, is subjected to a machining process.
