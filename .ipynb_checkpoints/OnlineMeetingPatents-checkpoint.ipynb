The stretch release adhesive can be used for extracting an electrical component from an interior surface of a housing of a mobile computing device. The stretch release adhesive can have a double-sided adhesive body configured to adhere the component to the interior surface of the housing. A portion of the double-sided adhesive body is configured to extend out from between the electrical component and the interior surface of the housing to provide a graspable portion. When the stretch release adhesive is adhered between the electrical component and the internal surface of the housing, the stretch release adhesive can receive a pulling force at the graspable portion. If pulled with enough force, the stretch release adhesive will extend outwardly from between the electrical component and the internal surface of the mobile computing device, then completely release the electrical component from the mobile computing device.</td>\n",

Shrinking supports of the same material are formed above the shrinking platform, and a desired part of the same material is formed upon them. A sliding release layer is provided below the shrinking platform of equal or larger surface area than a bottom of the shrinking platform to lateral resistance between the shrinking platform and an underlying surface. The matrix is debound sufficient to form a shape-retaining brown part assembly including the shrinking platform, shrinking supports, and the desired part. The shape-retaining brown part assembly is heated to shrink all of the components together at a same rate via atomic diffusion.  \n",

Each knife edge is titled and rises, relative to the rotation axis, between a first blade-edge location corresponding to a minor blade radius and a second blade-edge location corresponding to a major blade radius such that, when the circular blade is rotating in the predetermined cutting direction and cutting a work piece, the work piece first encounters the first blade-edge location of each cutting knife before encountering the second blade-edge location of that cutting knife.  \n",

The sensor may scan the workpiece as the workpiece is moved relative to the transport by a human operator or a positioning device. Based on the scan data, the computer system may generate commands to guide the human operator or positioning device in moving the workpiece to a desired position corresponding to a cut solution for the workpiece. Optionally, the computer system may cause the cutting member to be repositioned while the workpiece is being moved relative to the transport. Once the workpiece is in the desired position, the transport may be used to move the workpiece toward the cutting member. Corresponding methods and apparatuses are also disclosed.  \n",

The use of such coatings may yield composite sheet materials having improved surface quality, sharper edges, and greater draw angles than previously possible. Some systems for making thin-layer fiber composite materials may utilize ormosil coatings on various working surfaces of equipment coming into contact with the fiber and resin mixture, such as surfaces of machinery for mixing or conveying the mixture to the dies.  \n",
