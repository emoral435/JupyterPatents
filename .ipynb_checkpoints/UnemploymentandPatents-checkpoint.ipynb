The stretch release adhesive can be used for extracting an electrical component from an interior surface of a housing of a mobile computing device. The stretch release adhesive can have a double-sided adhesive body configured to adhere the component to the interior surface of the housing. A portion of the double-sided adhesive body is configured to extend out from between the electrical component and the interior surface of the housing to provide a graspable portion. When the stretch release adhesive is adhered between the electrical component and the internal surface of the housing, the stretch release adhesive can receive a pulling force at the graspable portion. If pulled with enough force, the stretch release adhesive will extend outwardly from between the electrical component and the internal surface of the mobile computing device, then completely release the electrical component from the mobile computing device.</td>\n",
