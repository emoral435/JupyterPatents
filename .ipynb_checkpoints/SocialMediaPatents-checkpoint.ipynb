       "      <td>A stretch release adhesive is disclosed. The stretch release adhesive can be used for extracting an electrical component from an interior surface of a housing of a mobile computing device. The stretch release adhesive can have a double-sided adhesive body configured to adhere the component to the interior surface of the housing. A portion of the double-sided adhesive body is configured to extend out from between the electrical component and the interior surface of the housing to provide a graspable portion. When the stretch release adhesive is adhered between the electrical component and the internal surface of the housing, the stretch release adhesive can receive a pulling force at the graspable portion. If pulled with enough force, the stretch release adhesive will extend outwardly from between the electrical component and the internal surface of the mobile computing device, then completely release the electrical component from the mobile computing device.</td>\n",

Media item classification may use models for associating language identifiers or probability distributions for multiple languages with linguistic content. User language classification may define user language models for attributing to users indications of languages they speak read, and/or write. The text classifications and user classifications may interact because the probability that given text is in a particular language may depend on a determined likelihood the user who produced the text speaks that language, or conversely, a user interacting with text in a particular language may increase the likelihood they understand that language. Some embodiments use language-tagged social media content to train n-gram classifiers for use with other social media content.  \n",

       "3       Social networking media system and applicationA system and method of regulating the display of digital content media in a social media platform is described. The method includes processing digital content media via one or more processors. The processors are in communication with an input/output interface and a database. Each item of digital content media is associated with a particular user and stored in a database. The system displays the digital content media within a media feed through the input/output interface in accordance to the preferences of each user. Command data is received and processed for each user. The system automatically allocates the placement of the digital content media according to a defined point value. Each digital content media is assigned a point value by the posting user which is automatically ranked by the system in accordance with the assigned point value. The system updates the media feed to reflect new and modified point values.  \n",
